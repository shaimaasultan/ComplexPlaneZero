# Complex Plane Zero
Zero Value in Complex Plane
This mainly means 
*  (1) you can Zero any term by just multiply it by (e^pi*i + 1).
*  (2) any natural numer away from Zero with a distance = its N power; for example the second power (X^2 * e^pi*i + X^2) = 0 * i; needs X^2 to reach Zero
*  (3) each natural number moves a way from zero with a step Equal to the natural number itself. (X * e^pi*i + X) = 0 * i; needs X to reach Zero
